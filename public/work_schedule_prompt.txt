### Task:
You are an assistant tasked with helping plan employee schedules. I will provide you with the following details:
1. A json of employees, including their preferred hours of work and their availability.
2. A json of absences, indicating when each employee is on vacation.
2. A json of workforce requirements, indicating the number of hours of total work required for each day.

Your task is to analyze the availability of employees and the required workforce for each day and propose a schedule that maximizes efficiency. The schedule should allocate work hours to employees such that:
- There is always a response for each weekday, as defined in the third json (workforce requirements).
- Each dayâ€™s required workforce is met as good as possible
- Employees are not scheduled during their vacation or appointments.
- Workload is evenly distributed across available employees as much as possible.

### Input:
Here is the Employee List as a JSON:
<INPUT-EMPLOYEE-INFO>

Here is the Absences List as a JSON:
<INPUT-ABSENCES-INFO>

Here is the Workforce Requirements as a JSON:
<INPUT-REQUIREMENTS-INFO>

### Output:
 Please return **only** the proposed work schedule as a JSON object, with no additional explanations or commentary. The format should look like this:

 ```json
{
  "schedule": [
    {
      "date": "string",              // Date in the format YYYY-MM-DD
      "assignments": [
        {
          "employee": "string",      // Last name of the employee
          "hours": "number"          // Number of hours assigned
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
