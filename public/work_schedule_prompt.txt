You are an assistant tasked with helping plan employee schedules. I will provide you with the following details:
1. A list of employees, including their vacation periods and appointments when they are unavailable.
2. A list of workforce requirements, indicating the number of hours my organization needs to be worked on each day.

Your task is to analyze the availability of employees and the required workforce for each day and propose a schedule that maximizes efficiency. The schedule should allocate work hours to employees such that:
- Each dayâ€™s required workforce is met.
- Employees are not scheduled during their vacation or appointments.
- Workload is evenly distributed across available employees as much as possible.

Here is the data in JSON format:

<INPUT-DATA>

Please return the proposed work schedule as a JSON object where each day lists the employees assigned and the number of hours they should work. The format should look like this:

```json
{
  "schedule": [
    {
      "date": "2023-09-10",
      "assignments": [
        { "employee": "Alice", "hours": 4 },
        { "employee": "Bob", "hours": 4 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "date": "2023-09-11",
      "assignments": [
        { "employee": "Alice", "hours": 4 },
        { "employee": "Carol", "hours": 4 }
      ]
    }
  ]
